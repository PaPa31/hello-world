The Mine of Babel.
Just another repository.
If the Tower of Babel was a bad idea for humanity, which ended languages multiplication,
because people wanted to reach heaven, the mine of Babel is a good idea,
which should lead to a single language, 
because people will build the building leading to hell.
Joke.
