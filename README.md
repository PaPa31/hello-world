Babel mine. 
Just another repository. 
If the Tower of Babel was a bad idea for humanity, which ended in a multiplication of languages because people wanted to reach heaven, then the Mine of Babel is a good idea that should lead to a single language, because people will build a building that leads to hell. Joke.
